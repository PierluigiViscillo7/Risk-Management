# Risk-Management
The objective of this project is to develop and test different Value-at-Risk models using MATLAB.
The models are:
– GARCH with error term following a t-distribution;
– GJR–GARCH with error term following a t-distribution;
– CAViaR – Asymmetric Slope (CAViaR–AS), Engle and Manganelli(2004);
– CAViaR – Indirect GARCH(1,1) (CAViaR–IG), Engle and Manganelli(2004);

The models will be backtested using Unconditional Coverage test, Independence Test, and Conditional
Coverage Test.
