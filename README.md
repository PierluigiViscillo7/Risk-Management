# Risk-Management
The objective of this project is to develop and test different Value-at-Risk models using MATLAB.
The models are:
1. GARCH with error term following a t-distribution;
2. GJR–GARCH with error term following a t-distribution;
3. CAViaR – Asymmetric Slope (CAViaR–AS), Engle and Manganelli(2004);
4. CAViaR – Indirect GARCH(1,1) (CAViaR–IG), Engle and Manganelli(2004);

The models will be backtested using Unconditional Coverage test, Independence Test, and Conditional
Coverage Test.
The Main file contains an example on how to use the functions.
